## Security Features

WebSage is designed with security and privacy as core principles:

### 🔒 Data Protection
- **Local Storage Only**: All API keys and conversation data stored locally in browser
- **No External Tracking**: Zero analytics, telemetry, or user behavior tracking
- **HTTPS Only**: All API communications use secure HTTPS connections
- **Client-Side Processing**: NLP analysis performed locally without external services
- **No Data Transmission**: User data never sent to WebSage servers (we don't have any)

### 🛡️ API Key Security
- **Encrypted Storage**: API keys stored using Chrome's secure storage APIs
- **Never Exposed**: Keys never appear in DOM, console logs, or network requests
- **User Controlled**: Users manage their own API keys directly with providers
- **Secure Transmission**: Keys only sent directly to respective AI providers over HTTPS

### 🔐 Content Security
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs sanitized before processing
- **XSS Prevention**: Content Security Policy and safe DOM manipulation
- **Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries and safe string handling
- **Context Isolation**: Extension runs in isolated context from web pages

### 🌐 Network Security
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only requests necessary permissions for functionality
- **Host Restrictions**: Limited to HTTPS websites only
- **No Third-Party Scripts**: All code bundled with extension, no external dependencies
- **Secure Headers**: Proper security headers in all network requests
